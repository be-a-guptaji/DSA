Question: 1. Two Sum

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]


Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
Only one valid answer exists.


Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

/*
Approach: We can solve this problem using a HashMap to store the numbers and their indices.
We iterate through the array and check if the complement of the current number exists in the HashMap.
If it does, we return the indices of the current number and the complement.
If the complement does not exist, we add the current number to the HashMap with its index as the value.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
