Question: 97. Interleaving String

Problem Statement: Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.

An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m substrings respectively, such that:

s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
|n - m| <= 1
The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...
Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.

Example 1:
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true
Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".
Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" = "aadbbcbcac".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
Output: false
Explanation: Notice how it is impossible to interleave s2 with any other string to obtain s3.

Example 3:
Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
Output: true

Constraints:

0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
0 <= s3.length <= 200
s1, s2, and s3 consist of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: Could you solve it using only O(s2.length) additional memory space?

/*
Approach: We solve the Interleaving String problem using Dynamic Programming with space optimization.

1. We are given three strings: s1, s2, and s3.
2. The goal is to determine if s3 can be formed by interleaving s1 and s2.
   - Interleaving means maintaining the relative order of characters in s1 and s2.
3. We use a 1D boolean DP array `dp[n+1]`, where:
   - dp[j] = true if s3[0..i+j-1] can be formed by interleaving s1[0..i-1] and s2[0..j-1].
4. Base Case:
   - dp[0] = true (empty prefixes form empty s3)
   - dp[j] = dp[j-1] && s2[j-1] == s3[j-1] (initially filling first row for s1 prefix length 0)
5. Transition:
   - For each i from 1 to m:
     - dp[0] = dp[0] && s1[i-1] == s3[i-1] (first column)
     - For each j from 1 to n:
       - dp[j] = (dp[j] && s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]) || (dp[j-1] && s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])
       - This updates dp[j] in-place using values from the previous row and current row.
6. After filling the DP array, dp[n] contains the answer: true if s3 can be formed by interleaving s1 and s2, false otherwise.

Time Complexity: O(m*n)
Space Complexity: O(n) â€” optimized from O(m*n)
