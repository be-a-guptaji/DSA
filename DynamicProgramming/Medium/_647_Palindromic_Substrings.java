Question: 647. Palindromic Substrings

Problem Statement: Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of lowercase English letters.

/*
Approach: We use the **Expand Around Center** technique to count all palindromic substrings in a given string.

1. For a string of length `n`, there are `2n - 1` possible centers for palindromic substrings:
   - Each character (for odd-length palindromes)
   - Each pair of adjacent characters (for even-length palindromes)
2. For each center (i, i) and (i, i+1), expand outwards while the characters on both sides are equal.
3. Every time a valid palindrome is found, increment the count.
4. This solution uses no extra memory beyond a few variables â€” it's space-efficient.

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the string.
Space Complexity: O(1), since we only use constant extra space.
