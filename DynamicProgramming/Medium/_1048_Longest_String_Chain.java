Question: 1048. Longest String Chain

Problem Statement: You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.

For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].

Example 2:
Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5
Explanation: All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].

Example 3:
Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.
["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 16
words[i] only consists of lowercase English letters.

Approach:
This solution handles the "Longest String Chain" (Leetcode 1048) problem.

Key Idea:
- Use Dynamic Programming (DP) to find the longest possible chain of words where
  each word in the chain is formed by adding exactly one character to the previous word.
- Each word can extend the chain of a shorter predecessor if the shorter word can become
  the current word by inserting exactly one letter.

Steps:
1. Sort the array of words based on their lengths.
   - This ensures that all potential predecessor words appear before longer words.
2. Initialize a `dp` array of size `n` (where n = number of words) with all values as 1.
   - Each word is a valid chain of length 1 by itself.
3. For each word `i` in the sorted array:
   - Check all previous words `j` where `j < i`.
   - If `words[j]` can be a valid predecessor of `words[i]` 
     (i.e., `words[j].length() + 1 == words[i].length()` and differs by one character),
     then update:
       `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.
4. Track the maximum value in `dp` which represents the length of the longest string chain.
5. Return the maximum chain length.

Helper Function:
- A helper method `canBeSuccessor(String shorter, String longer)` is used to check if 
  `shorter` can be transformed into `longer` by adding exactly one character.

Time Complexity: O(nÂ² * L), where n is the number of words and L is the average word length.
Space Complexity: O(n), due to the `dp` array.
