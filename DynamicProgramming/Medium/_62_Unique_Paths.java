Question: 62. Unique Paths

Problem Statement: There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.

Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28

Example 2:
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 100

/*
Approach:
We use a dynamic programming strategy with memoization to solve the problem of decoding a string of digits,
where each digit or pair of digits can represent a letter (e.g., '1' -> 'A', ..., '26' -> 'Z').

Steps:
- If the string starts with '0', return 0 because '0' cannot be decoded on its own.
- If the string length is 1 and not '0', return 1 since there's only one way to decode it.

- Initialize an integer array `ways[]` of size equal to the length of the string to store the number of ways
  to decode substrings up to each index.

- Base cases:
    - ways[0] = 1 (there's at least one valid way to decode the first character unless it's '0')
    - For the second character:
        - If the first two characters form a valid 2-digit code (10â€“26), and the second character is not '0', set ways[1] = 2
        - If the second character is '0', it must be part of a valid two-digit code with the first character (10 or 20),
          so set ways[1] = 1
        - If none of the above apply, set ways[1] = 1

- For each character from index 2 onward:
    - If the current character is not '0', add ways[i - 1] to ways[i]
    - If the 2-digit number formed by the previous character and current character is between 10 and 26, add ways[i - 2]
    - If the current character is '0' and not part of a valid 2-digit number (like '30', '40', etc.), return 0

- Finally, return ways[size - 1], which contains the number of ways to decode the full message.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Space Complexity: O(n), due to the use of the `ways` array for memoization.
