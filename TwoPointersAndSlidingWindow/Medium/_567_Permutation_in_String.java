Question: 567. Permutation in String

Problem Statement: Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

Example 1:
Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false 

Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 10^4
s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

 /*
 Approach:This problem is best solved using the **sliding window** technique with frequency counting.
 
 - We maintain two frequency arrays (size 26) to track:
  1. The count of characters in the string `s1`.
  2. The count of characters in the current sliding window of size `s1.length()` in `s2`.
 
 - We initialize both arrays and compare them.
 - Then we slide the window one character at a time by:
    - Adding the next character to the window
    - Removing the oldest character from the window
    - Comparing the two frequency arrays
 
 - If they match at any point, we return true.
 
 This approach ensures we efficiently check each window in linear time.
 
 Time Complexity: O(n)
 - where `n` is the length of `s2`. Each character is visited only once during the sliding window.
 - Array comparison (`Arrays.equals`) is O(26) per comparison, which is constant time â€” treated as O(1).
 
 Space Complexity: O(1)
 - We use two fixed-size arrays (size 26), regardless of the input size.
