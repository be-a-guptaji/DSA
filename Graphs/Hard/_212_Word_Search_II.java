Question: 212. Word Search II

Problem Statement: Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

Example 1:
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]

Example 2:
Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
Output: []

Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 12
board[i][j] is a lowercase English letter.
1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10^4
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
All the strings of words are unique.

Approach:
1. This problem is a great use-case for **Trie (Prefix Tree)** combined with **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The board is a 2D grid of characters.
   - The goal is to find all words from the given list that can be constructed by navigating adjacent cells (up/down/left/right).
   - Each cell can be used only once per word.
   - A naive solution would check every word against every board path, which is inefficient.
   - Using a **Trie** allows us to stop early during DFS when no word starts with the current prefix.
2. Trie Construction (Preprocessing Step):
   - We build a Trie (prefix tree) from the list of words.
   - Each node in the Trie represents a character.
   - Each complete path from the root to a node marked `isEndOfWord = true` represents a complete word from the list.
   - This structure helps in pruning paths early during DFS traversal â€” we only explore further if the prefix exists in the Trie.
3. DFS Search on the Board:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` on the board:
     - We check if the character at `(i, j)` is the starting letter of any word in the Trie.
     - If yes, we start a DFS from that cell.
   - During DFS:
     - We explore in four directions (up, down, left, right).
     - We track visited cells using a `boolean[][] visited` array to prevent revisiting a cell in the same path.
     - At each step, we append the current character to a string (`str`) and move to the corresponding child node in the Trie.
     - If the current Trie node is marked as `isEndOfWord`, we add the current string to the result set.
4. Backtracking:
   - After exploring all paths from a cell, we backtrack by marking it as unvisited.
   - This allows the cell to be reused in other paths starting from different locations.
5. Result Collection:
   - We use a `Set<String>` to collect valid words found during DFS traversal to avoid duplicates.
   - After completing DFS for the whole board, we iterate through the original word list and check which of them are in the result set.
   - This ensures we return only those words from the input list, in the required format.

Time Complexity: O(N * L + M * 4^L)
- N = number of words in the word list
- L = maximum length of a word
- M = total number of cells in the board
- Building the Trie takes O(N * L)
- DFS from each cell could take up to O(4^L) in the worst case (exponential with word length),
  but is pruned significantly due to the Trie structure
Space Complexity: O(N * L + M)
- O(N * L) for storing the Trie
- O(M) for the visited matrix (`boolean[][] visited`)
- Additional O(L) stack space used by the recursion for each DFS path
