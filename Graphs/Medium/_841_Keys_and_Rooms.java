Question: 841. Keys and Rooms

Problem Statement: There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.

Example 2:
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.

Constraints:

n == rooms.length
2 <= n <= 1000
0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000
0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
All the values of rooms[i] are unique.

/*
Approach: BFS Traversal

1. Treat each room as a node in a graph and keys as directed edges to other rooms.
2. Start from room 0 (since itâ€™s unlocked by default) and perform BFS:
   - Use a queue to process rooms level by level.
   - Use a visited array to mark rooms once they are visited.
   - For each room, add all the keys it contains into the queue.
3. Continue BFS until no more rooms can be visited.
4. After traversal, check if all rooms are marked as visited.
   - If yes, return true (all rooms can be visited).
   - If not, return false (some rooms are unreachable).

Time Complexity: O(N + K), where N = number of rooms and K = total number of keys across all rooms.  
Space Complexity: O(N), for the visited array and queue.
